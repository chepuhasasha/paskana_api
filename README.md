# Paskana Monitoring Backend Structure

This repository contains the skeleton of a NestJS backend service used to monitor marketplace sales (Ozon, Wildberries).

## Modules

- **Auth** - handles user authentication using JWT.
- **Users** - manages user data.
- **Marketplace** - stores API tokens for marketplace accounts.
- **Metrics** - saves sales, orders, stock and rating metrics.
- **Scheduler** - periodically collects data from marketplaces.

The code files are placeholders with brief comments describing their purpose.
